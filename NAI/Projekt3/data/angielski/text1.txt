Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.[79] Dogs' minds have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans; dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans; they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.[13] Behavioral scientists thought that a set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs that are not possessed by the dog's canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, are parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.[80]
Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.[81][82] In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs.[83] These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response[82][84] (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing.[82] Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.[82][85] Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds.[82] Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.[86] In a 2023 study of 58 dogs, some dogs classified as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like (ADHD-like) showed lower serotonin and dopamine concentrations.[87] A similar study claims that hyperactivity is more common in male and young dogs.[88] A dog can become aggressive because of trauma or abuse, fear or anxiety, territorial protection, or protecting an item it considers valuable.[89] Acute stress reactions from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) seen in dogs can evolve into chronic stress.[90] Police dogs with PTSD can often refuse to work.[91]
Dogs have a natural instinct called prey drive (the term is chiefly used to describe training dogs' habits); the behaviour can be influenced by the dogs' breeds. Dogs' instincts can consider objects or other animals to be their prey or to be their valuables; some dogs have killed vermin.[92] Puppies or dogs sometimes bury food underground. A study found that wolves outperformed dogs in finding food caches; the study suggested that it was likely due to a 'difference in motivation' between wolves and dogs.[93] Some puppies and dogs engage in coprophagy out of habit, stress, for attention, or boredom; most of them will not do it later in life. A study hypothesizes that the behavior was inherited from wolves, who do it to keep their dens free of intestinal parasites.[94]
The female dog may produce colostrum 1â€“7 days before giving birth, lasting for around three months.[97][98] Colostrum peak production was around 3 weeks postpartum and increased with litter size.[98] The dog can sometimes vomit and refuse food during child contractions.[99] In the later stages of the dog's pregnancy, nesting behaviour may occur.[100] Puppies are born with a protective fetal membrane that the mother usually removes shortly after birth. Dogs can have the maternal instincts to start grooming their puppies, consume their puppies' feces, and protect their puppies, likely due to their hormonal state.[101][102] While male-parent dogs can show more disinterested behaviour toward their own puppies,[103] most can play with the young pups as they would with other dogs or humans.[104] A female dog may abandon or attack her puppies or her
